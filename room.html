				<h1> How to play </h1>
				<p> Today we will be learning three different spells. You win if your spell is successful. You have 10 attempts to cast any combination of the three options. Make sure to spell them exactly as they're written below (no pun intended) <br/>
				<b>Expelliarmus</b> : (Easy) Defensive spell that disarms your opponents  <br/>
				<b>Reducto</b> : (Medium) A curse that can be used to blast solid objects to pieces <br/>
				<b>ExpectoPatronum</b> : (Hard) The only known defense against Dementors. Conjure your animal Patronus by thinking of the happiest memory you can. </p>
